# Meal Spark

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

Meal Spark is a tool for storing your favorite meal ideas for a quick way to spark your memory when trying to decide what to cook for your next meal. This is a not a recipe app with detailed instructions; it is meant to serve as inspiration for what to cook next and displays a short description of the meal to jog your memory plus a list of ingredients to quickly add to your shopping list.

When you discover a new meal you enjoy, you can quickly add the meal to your collection with a title, short description, ingredients, and photo. You can also tag your meals with a variety of categories for filtering later when searching for a specific type of meal.

You can find the live app [**here**](https://meal-spark.vercel.app/) and try it out with the demo account.
